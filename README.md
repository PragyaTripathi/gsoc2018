## Code for Nepal's Google Summer of Code 2018 ##

This repository serves as platform for hosting Code for Nepal's Google Summer of Code 2018 related tasks.
While most of our project ideas would have their own repository, this repository would serve as a "tracking hub" to keep track of documentation and other booking tasks.

### Gettings started ###
In order to get started head over to [Getting started](https://github.com/Code4Nepal/gsoc2018/wiki) page.
